# Trajectory-Interception
Path Planning Project: Catch me if you Can
The Project contains two sub-modules
1. GUI in C++ that can be used as general purpose visualizer for planning algorithms with minimal modifications
2. Planner to plan paths to intercept the target trajectory, the implementation is 3D A-Star algorithms that reasons in X,Y and Time to intercept the trajectory in the most optimal way possible
